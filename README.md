# Innovation Hub

The Innovation Hub seeks to inform, educate, share, and communicate the activities of the Legislative branch toward data standardization and increased transparency through improved use of digital tools. The Hub includes information to help law-making bodies innovate, communicate, and legislate effectively, and it is being developed iteratively by non-partisan support staff in United States Legislative branch organizations coordinated through the Bulk Data Task Force in collaboration with civil society using GitHub Pages.
