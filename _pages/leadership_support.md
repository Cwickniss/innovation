## Leadership Support
<p>In 2011, the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/HMAN-111/pdf/HMAN-111.pdf">rules</a> of the United States House of Representatives for the 112th Congress called for greater transparency and accessibility to legislative documents. The intention of the change was to place electronic distribution on par with traditional printing. On June 1, 2012, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/crpt/112/hrpt/511">House Report 112-511</a> that accompanied <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/bills/112/hr/5882?billversion=rh&link-type=xml">H.R. 5882</a> the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 2013 directed the establishment of the Bulk Data Task Force to examine the increased dissemination of Congressional information via bulk data download by non-governmental groups for the purpose of supporting openness and transparency in the legislative process.</p>

<p>The Bulk Data Task Force is a partnership of representatives from Legislative branch organizations such as the
Government Publishing Office, House of Representatives, Senate, and the Library of Congress working in a cooperative manner to coordinate and accomplish openness and transparency goals. Civil society organizations frequently meet with and provide feedback to the Bulk Data Task Force.</p>
